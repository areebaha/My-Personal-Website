        <p id=blurb> I attended Cornell's Health Hackathon, which centered around creating innovative technical solutions to some of
          the most pressing healthcare challenges. My team and I created Sobr, which focuses on recovering addicts after
          they initially receive medical treatment from a doctor. Patients can request clinical notes from their doctor, which is fed
          through a fine-tuned LLM to provide patient attributes. These attributes are then used to match patients to sponsors, who can
          voluntarily sign up to help patients recover. </p>

        <h1 id= projectTitle> Trainfo </h1>  
        <h3 class= "year"> 2024 </h3>
        <p id=blurb> Subway stations are vital to millions of New Yorkers who rely on them to travel within the city daily.
          However, 70% of subway stations aren't accessible, so people with disabilities, those carrying heavy luggage, strollers or              children can't use them. 
          Trainfo is an Android app that finds accessible stations and calculates accessible routes in New York City. 
          It provides real time data on train-times in order to calculate efficient routes within the city and filters them for         
          accessibility. Design of the app is intended to be easy to navigate, with color-coded icons indicating accessibility within a           1-miles radius of the current location.</p>

        <p id=blurb> I created a website addressing women's illiteracy and the importance of their education. I used HTML, CSS, and 
          JavaScript for this website and created a fact generator, wrapped my images, and embedded videos.</p>
